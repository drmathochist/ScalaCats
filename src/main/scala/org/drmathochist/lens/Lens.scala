/**
 * At a high level, we think of a lens as a way of "focusing" on one part of an overall structure.  We can evaluate
 * that part, or we can update the structure by replacing that part.
 *
 * In this implementation, we define a lens by a certain higher natural transformation.
 * The source HFunctor is Eval[S, _], which evaluates a functor at the type S of the overall structure.
 * The target HFunctor is Store[A, _] ~> _, which is the type of natural transformations from the functor Store[A, _]
 * to another given functor, and where A is the type of the piece of S under examination.
 *
 * The Yoneda lemma translates this natural transformation back and forth into a particular store object,
 * from which we can extract getters and setters as usual.  The advantage of using the natural transformation
 * as the defining data is that lenses compose exactly by composing their natural transformations!
 *
 * @param vL The natural transformation defining the lens
 * @tparam A The type of the "piece" the lens focuses on
 * @tparam S The type of the overall object the lens analyzes
